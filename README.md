# Why would I pick MEAN?
All of the components of the MEAN stack are reliable, well-understood, and open source, but so are many other development stacks. Here are some reasons you might choose MEAN over other development stacks.

Your data isn't highly structured

MongoDB is what's called a NoSQL database. A NoSQL database doesn't require data to be structured in a pre-defined way as it would with a relational database like Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL. Instead, MongoDB stores its data in JSON-like documents that don't require the rigid data structures that MySQL or other relational databases require.

# MEAN is well documented

The components of the MEAN stack are all popular right now. Resources for working with MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js are easy to find.

# MEAN runs almost anywhere

You can also develop MEAN stack applications from your favorite development environment â€“ whether that's Windows, macOS, or Linux.
